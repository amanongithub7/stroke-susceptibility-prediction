# 🩺 Patient Stroke Susceptibility Prediction

This is a data science project that: 
1. analyzes and visualizes relationships between different predictor variables of a patients' health data, 
2. transforms predictor variables leveraging p-value analysis and dimensionality reduction, and 
3. trains and compate different Machine Learning models such as logistic regression, random forests and neural networks on stroke susceptibility prediction.

Please refer to the Python notebook for the code, the csv file for the data and the pdf for an in-depth report of my findings.
